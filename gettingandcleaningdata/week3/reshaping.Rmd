# Melting data frames

Basically it takes a data frame and flips it so it's tall and skinny, based on the id names (`id`) you provide and the variables (`measure.vars()`)
```{r}
mtcars$carname <- rownames(mtcars)
carMelt <- melt(mtcars, id = c("carname", "gear", "cyl"), 
                        measure.vars = c("mpg", "hp"))
head(carMelt)
```

# Casting data frames

We can do this using the `dcast()` function. In this way we can see how certain variables vary by factors. E.g. 

```{r}
cylData <- dcast(carMelt, cyl ~ variable)
cylData # basically gives you measure counts
```

You can also give it a metric to summarize, e.g.
```{r}
dcast(carMelt, cyl ~ variable, mean)
```
