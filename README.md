# Data Science Coursera

This is the repository where I will keep my notes for the Coursera Data Science specialization

## File hierarchy
* `course_content/` contains the folders with all the courses, from the Data Scientist Toolbox up to the Capstone (tentative)
* `.gitignore` tells us which files are ignore by git, and gives you a list of the names of the folders containing data, as well as their paths
* `HelloWorld.md` is one of the first files commited 
* `README.md` is this file
