Let's begin examining this in our spam/ham example

```{r}
library(caret)
library(kernlab)
data(spam)

inTrain <- createDataPartition(y = spam$type, p = 0.75, list = F)
     
training <- spam[inTrain, ]
testing <- spam[-inTrain, ]

M <- abs(cor(training[, -58]))
diag(M) <- 0 # remove things correlated with themselves
which(M>0.8, arr.ind = T)
```

We might not need every predictor. Some might be way too correlated. We should pick a combination that reduces noise and compress the data. So the goal is to **Find a new set of multivariate variables that are uncorrelated and explain as much variance as possible**. 

In caret you can use the `preProcess` function.
